It is configurable via solder bridges and can be configured as a C64 character ROM adapter, as well. It fits all VIC-20 mainboards and all C64 mainboards. It is a good solution for the C64 short board and a working solution for the C64 long boards. It might collide with a optional kernal adapter on the long boards, though, so the recommended solution for those is still the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/C64-CHARSET-Adaptor-Switch">C64 Character ROM Adapter</a>.
